### Excavator Control System

This repository contains the software and hardware implementation for controlling an excavator using a Raspberry Pi 5. The project includes a load cell system for load detection and a lighting control system, ensuring efficient and safe operation.



The Excavator Control System enables wireless operation and monitoring of an excavator. Using a load cell sensor, we can measure the load on the boom and enforce a safety threshold for lifting heavy objects. The lighting system ensures visibility during operation and enhances the aesthetic appeal of the excavator. The project has automated the algorithmic process using a Docker container system.
